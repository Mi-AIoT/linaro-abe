      "message": "Hello,\n\nChristophe noticed that ABE isn\u0027t able to cross-build GDB\u0027s master branch with MinGW.\nThis fixes the ABE side of the problem. Unfortunately there\u0027s also a minor issue in GDB itself for which I have a patch that I\u0027m currently testing and will post upstream soon.\n\nWith this change and also the GDB patch applied, I am able to build GDB\u0027s master branch with MinGW.",
