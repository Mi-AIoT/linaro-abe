      "message": "Hello,\n\nThere are the changes in v2:\n- Moved globals to lib/globals.sh.\n- Changed tests of boolean variables to follow convention.\n- Rewrote loop in make_check() to stop when the merged sum file stops changing. This also allows detecting when different tests in a single exp file change.\n- Fixed awk invocation to look for failed tests in all the sum files produced by the testsuite.\n- If the \"make ${check_targets}\" invocation fails, break out of the loop instead of continuing and only checking the last invocation after the loop finishes.",
