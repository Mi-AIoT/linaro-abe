      "message": "I think you can just use \n\"declare -a sums; sums\u003d($(find ${toplevel} -name \"gcc.sum*\"))\"\ninstead of the whole loop.  It should be in two statements, since it is preferable to have \"declare/local\" commands separate from non-trivial initializations (due to error-handling / return code issues).\nAlso, it is a good idea to quote any patterns with \u0027*\u0027 in them (gcc.sum* in this case) to avoid any possibility of shell * expansion.  If there happens to be gcc.sum-1 and gcc.sum-2 files in current directory, the command will be expanded into\n\"find ${toplevel} -name gcc.sum-1 gcc.sum-2\"",
