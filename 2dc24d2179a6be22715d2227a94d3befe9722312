In particular, gdb.linespec/cpcompletion.exp has 422 FAILs and gdb.mi/mi2-var-child.exp has 425 FAILs. A couple of tests in gdb.mi are still as flaky (and verbose) as before though.\n\nThe testsuite unexpected failures go from 56 to 1411. Still, the increased stability of the test results makes this change worth it.",
