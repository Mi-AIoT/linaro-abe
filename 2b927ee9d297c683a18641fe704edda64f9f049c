      "message": "when this is used on a build of a native compiler, it will strip all of the target binaries/libraries as well as the toolchain executables. This seems undesirable, although, since we don\u0027t currently release native toolchains it might not matter too much at the moment.\n\nThe alternative would be to make a list of directories which are expected to contain strippable binaries, but this would potentially be fragile.\n\nViews?",
