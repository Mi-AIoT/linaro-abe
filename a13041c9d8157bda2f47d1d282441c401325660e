After this change we will have same sets of files under ${destdir}/${host} as under ${local_builds}/destdir/${host}.\n\nIf my eye-balling of this change is correct, then you want to add \"/\" at the end of ${local_builds}/destdir/${host} to keep the directory layout.\n\nBTW, rsync\u0027s -a implies -r, so you can change \"-avr\" to \"-av\" with no difference in semantics.",
