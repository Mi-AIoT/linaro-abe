      "message": "IIRC, ABE supports building components using \"--build foobar.git\" and \"--build http://url.com/foobar.git\".  The first approach is a shortcut for the second and requires an entry for foobar.git in config/sources.conf.\n\nIf the above is correct, then this test checks whether the sources.conf entry exists.  Therefore, I think the problem is that $component is calculated to include \".git\" suffix, instead of stripping it.\n\nCould you check whether $component had .git suffix before (using xenial bash)?",
