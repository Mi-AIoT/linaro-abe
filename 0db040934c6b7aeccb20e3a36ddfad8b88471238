Unfortunately this quoting strategy isn\u0027t working when\nabe-tests/test-manifest2.sh reads the manifest and attempts to reproduce\nthe build.\n\nI suspect the problem is in test-manifest2.sh. I\u0027m looking into it.\n\n-- \n\n¹ https://ci.linaro.org/job/tcwg-abe-test/1352/label\u003dtcwg-x86_64-build,test\u003dabe-tests/artifact/artifacts/orig-manifest1.txt\n2 https://ci.linaro.org/job/tcwg-abe-test/1352/label\u003dtcwg-x86_64-build,test\u003dabe-tests/artifact/artifacts/orig-manifest2.txt\n",
