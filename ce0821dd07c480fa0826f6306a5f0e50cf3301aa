IIUC, they should work with all other dejagnu testsuites, it\u0027s just so far they have been tested only with GCC.\n\nFrom GNU toolchain point of view, it would be nice to integrate these wrappers into DejaGnu, and have buffering adjusted transparently (via an environment variable or dejagnu board setting) for any binutils/gdb/gcc/newlib testsuite.\n\nThis is just a question, not a request for a major rework :-) .",

      "message": "Indeed I think they should work with all components, but I have not checked yet.\nI have run the GCC testsuite with all these versions, with and without LANG\u003dC, but I still have to fully analyze the results (as the ones I had had plenty of random errors -- spawn/fork failed)\n\nSupporting these from DejaGnu would be nice indeed, but might involve long arguing with maintainers and users, but it would be more transparent and possibly provide more flexibility (eg only change buffering for compiler/tool output or for executable messages)",
