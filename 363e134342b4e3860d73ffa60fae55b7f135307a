      "message": "We need a path to reducing the number of unstable tests on targets of interests (arm, aarch64, x86_64).  Especially with declaring all asan and ubsan tests unstable, we are, essentially, removing big chunk of sanitizer verification from our testing.\n\nI\u0027m OK with declaring any individual tests unstable, but not a whole directory.\n\nAlso, I think we should create \"enhancement\" bugzilla entries to investigate why each of above categories of tests are unstable (and add links to these bugzillas in the file).",
