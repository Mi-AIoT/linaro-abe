      "message": "IIUC, this approach makes every build that goes to $try\u003e\u003d1 re-detect as many flaky tests as it can.  While it would provide the most comprehensive statistics on the flaky tests, it would also significantly increase runtime, especially of less-stable testsuites like GDB.\n\nAs a middle-ground between current and proposed states -- how about keep the logic to continue/stop iteration as-is, and only change how $new_flaky list is generated?  For the addition to $new_flaky list we would ignore $baseline_flaky list and take into account only $new_flaky and $prev_try_fails lists?\n\nIn other words, if on $try\u003d\u003d1 we see a FAIL that was a PASS on $try\u003d\u003d0, we add it to $new_flaky irrespective of whether it is already present in $baseline_flaky.  But we will not go into $try\u003d\u003d2 iteration due to this known-and-confirmed flaky detection.",
