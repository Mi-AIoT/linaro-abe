      "message": "I missed that sysroot was set here.\n\nI see that lib/make.sh sets SYSROOT_UNDER_TEST, and config/linaro.exp sets sysroot to SYSROOT_UNDER_TEST.  So it works because we are setting sysroot twice also.  The two sysroot values should be the same, because the lib/make.sh value gets passed to gcc configure via --with-sysroot, and then we are querying the gcc value here.\n\nI agree it looks funny to use sysroot and then set it.  I could just move the QEMU_LD_PREFIX set to after the sysroot set and not worry about the fact that syroot is set twice.\n\nI\u0027d also need the same change in my pending aarch64-qemu.exp file.",
