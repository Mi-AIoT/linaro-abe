This function is used as a generic \"find item in list\" in various places.\n\nA similar problem occurs with \"stage1\" and \"stage2\" being alternate names for the \"gcc\" component. This is already handled in build_step_CHECK in lib/control.sh, and I think that it might be better to handle the libc-\u003e{newlib,glibc,eglibc} case there too.",
