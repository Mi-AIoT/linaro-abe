      "message": "This hunk is inside build_all() function, which means that we are likely to fetch/checkout linux kernel sources even when not building it.\n\nRather than removing \"linux\" from $builds it is better to not add it there in the first place.  E.g., condition adding \"linux\" to $depends inside config/infrastructure.conf on whether $target is bare-metal.  That should prevent any part of ABE from dealing with \"linux\".",
