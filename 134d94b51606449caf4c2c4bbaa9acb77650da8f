(I\u0027ve just pushed the fix to binutils/master)\n\nMy imnpression is that DVI is an outdated format, superseded by PDF.\nBut considering that you already posted patches fixing DVI installation in all components (thanks!), I think there\u0027s no harm in adding this patch.\n\nAs a data point, the gdb package in Ubuntu installs the following files:\n\n$ ls -l /usr/share/doc/gdb/refcard.*\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 7,3K Sep  7  2023 /usr/share/doc/gdb/refcard.dvi.gz\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 125K Sep  7  2023 /usr/share/doc/gdb/refcard.ps.gz\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 7,9K Sep  6  2023 /usr/share/doc/gdb/refcard.tex.gz\n\nThough interestingly, the gdb-doc package only installs the HTML and PDF files...",
