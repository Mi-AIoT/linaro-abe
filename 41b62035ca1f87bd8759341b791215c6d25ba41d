I don\u0027t understand this comment.\n\nWhat I mean is that we could put here:\n\necho \u003e \"$prev_fails\"\n\nIn later commits this would be changed to:\n\necho \u003e \"$orig_fails\"\n[ \"$flaky_failures\" \u003d \"\" ] \u0026\u0026 echo \u003e \"$flaky_fails\"\n\nBut like I said before, not much would change in practice.",
