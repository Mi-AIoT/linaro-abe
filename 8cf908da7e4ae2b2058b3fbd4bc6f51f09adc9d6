      "message": "target\u003d\"\" is not a new option, it is a small cleanup to declare a variable.\n\nThe testcontainer_file used to be passed as a normal value, but that means that the test container needs to up before we start jenkins.sh.  This changed it to what it is now: https://review.linaro.org/#/c/14780/1/tcwg-buildfarm-maxim.yaml .\n\nAt the start of the jenkins.sh the $testcontainer_file doesn\u0027t exist yet, and it is created by this http://git.linaro.org/ci/job/configs.git/blob/HEAD:/tcwg-test-container-matrix.yaml#l98 once the testing container is up and running.\n\nUsually this happens in 3-4 minutes, but I have seen cases under heavy load where test container was starting up for 20 minutes.",
