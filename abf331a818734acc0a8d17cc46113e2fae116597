To make that possible, this change uses \u0027@@\u0027 to represent the dollar sign.\n\nThis is my second try. My first was at https://review.linaro.org/c/toolchain/abe/+/41555 and didn\u0027t work because the dollar sign didn\u0027t \"survive\" when Abe tried to recreate the toolchain build using the manifest file.",
