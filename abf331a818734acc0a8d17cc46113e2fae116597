      "message": "Hello,\n\nThe aim is to add the option \u0027--with-auto-load-safe-path\u003d$debugdir:$datadir/auto-load:/path/to/abe/sysroots\u0027 to GDB\u0027s configure script so that it can load libthread_db.so.1 when the testsuite runs.\nNote that \"$debugdir:$datadir\" aren\u0027t variables and have to appear unmodified. To make that possible, this change uses \u0027@@\u0027 to represent the dollar sign.\n\nThis is my second try. My first was at https://review.linaro.org/c/toolchain/abe/+/41555 and didn\u0027t work because the dollar sign didn\u0027t \"survive\" when Abe tried to recreate the toolchain build using the manifest file.",

The \"problem\" can be found in the files test_previous_abe_cmd_line_gcc{4_9,5,6,7}.log. It is caused by compare-manifests.pl noticing that the gdb_configure parameter is different after my patch, which is precisely the intent of this change request.\n\nSo this failure is expected, since any commit that changes a parameter present in the manifest file will trigger it.",

I just wanted something that doesn\u0027t have any meaning in bash scripts. I initially chose just \"@\" but then I thought it could interfere in the future if we have to add an email address as configure parameter for some reason...",
